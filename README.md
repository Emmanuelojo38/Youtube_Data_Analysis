# Youtube_Data_Analysis
This is an end to end Data Engineering Project!

PROJECT OVERVIEW[working backwards from what does the customer need]
Requirements:
-Launching a new data-driven campaign
-Main advertising channel: YouTube
-Initial questions to answer:
    -how to categorise videos, based on their comments and statistics
    -what factors affect how popular a YouTube video will be 


WHY YOUTUBE?
Youtube is the 2nd most visited website in the world @34.6 billion visits monthly!


GOALS AND SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-Data Ingestion: ingest data, one-offs and incrementally.
-Data Lake: Design and build a new Data Lake Architecture
-AWS Cloud: AWS as a cloud provider
-ETL Design: Extract, transform, and load the data efficiently
-Scalability: The data architecture should scale efficiently
-Reporting: Build a Businesss intelligence tier, including; Dashboards.


WHAT TO LEARN!
-To build a data lake from scratch in Amazon S3; joining structured and semi-structured data.
-Lake House architecture design; best practices ->> cost and performance.
-Data Lake vs. Data Warehouse.
-Data Lake design in layers, partitioned for cost-performance; eg. landing, cleansed as SSOT, reporting for BI users, WORM model/Write Once Read Many
-AWS Data Catalogue
-ETL in AWS Glue Spark jobs; Amazon SageMaker, Jupyter Notebooks
-Amazon SNS for alerting
-SQL using Amazon Athena and Spark SQL; i.e. impact of querying the optimized data layers
-Write some scripts to ingest data incrementally and schema evolution
-BI dashboards in Amazon QuickSight.
